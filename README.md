# 🖼️ Image-to-Sketch Converter  
_Convert Images to Pencil Sketches using Python_

## 📖 Description
This project converts a normal image into a pencil sketch using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
By applying image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and edge detection, the input image is transformed to look like a hand-drawn pencil sketch.
